# EDS - Raha Variants
This repository contains several variants of Raha. Specifically, there are three different label distribution variations.

To run the precision experiment, please use this repo: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDS-Precision-Exp-2656/README.md

### Raha - 2LabelsPerCol (2LPC)
In this version, Raha randomly selects one column at a time and labels two cells from that column. 
This is repeated until the labeling budget is exhausted.

### Raha - 20LabelsPerCol (20LPC)
In this version, Raha randomly selects one column at a time and labels 20 cells from that column.
This is repeated until the labeling budget is exhausted.
### Raha - RandomTables (RT)
In this version, the datasets are shuffled and then assigned one label at a time until the labeling budget is exhausted.


## Installation
Create a fresh python environment
```shell
cd raha
conda env create -f benchmarks-env.yml
cd ..
```
## Usage
#### Raha - 2LPC and 20LPC
Both Raha versions will be executed by running:

``python raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/raha_not_enough_labels_column_wise.py``

This version can be configured in ``raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/hydra_configs/column_wise.yaml`` and 
``raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/hydra_configs/shared.yaml``
#### Raha - RT
This version can be executed by running:

``python raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/raha_not_enough_labels_lake.py``

This version can be configured in ``raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/hydra_configs/table_wise.yaml`` and 
``raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/hydra_configs/shared.yaml``
#### Raha - Standard
The standard Raha version can be executed by running:

``python raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/raha_enough_labels_lake.py``

This version can be configured in ``raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/hydra_configs/shared.yaml`` and 
``raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/hydra_configs/standard.yaml``

#### Results
The results can be extracted with ``raha/raha/get_raha_stats/get_benchmark_results.py``. 

1. Every result json must be collected per hand and put into one folder.
   - Standard: all json files
   - 2LPC, 20LPC and RT: all json files that have been run with the same labeling budget. This is recognizable at the 
   first number at the ``results_??_?`` folder (marked with ??)
2. Then, after configuring the config file ``raha/raha/eds_run_experiments/hydra_configs/results.yaml``, the results can be collected by running
``python ./raha/raha/get_raha_stats/get_benchmark_results.py``
